# BCSell
This is a Boston College themed marketplace app that tackles financial difficulties of many college students. Many students struggle to afford text books, clothes, and costly activities like concerts or other ticket-based events. Most methods like class group chats, or social media do not provide the best marketplace experience. BCSell allows students to buy and sell items at affordable prices to ameliorate financial painpoints of college students.
